topic: "Paradigms of authorship in generative AI creation"

contribution_statement: |
  This work reframes AI-assisted authorship as a procedural and accountable workflow.
  We argue that legitimacy in AI-supported scientific writing depends on transparent
  integration of AI into the research process rather than binary authorship claims.

    title: "Enough with Human–AI Collaboration"
    summary: |
      Argues that framing AI as a collaborator misrepresents agency and obscures
      the human labor embedded in system design. Positions AI as a tool whose
      outputs should not be anthropomorphized or treated as intentional creation.
    strengths:
      - Clear critique of anthropomorphic framing
      - Strong conceptual grounding
    limitations:
      - Focused more on framing than operational guidelines
    relation_to_work: |
      Supports a tool-based view consistent with procedural accountability.
    comments: "Anchors tool paradigm."

    title: "AI as a Research Partner"
    summary: |
      Proposes that AI may qualify as a contributor in academic contexts when it
      substantively shapes intellectual direction, challenging strict tool-only models.
    strengths:
      - Expands authorship discussion into co-creation
    limitations:
      - Normative stance lacks procedural criteria
    relation_to_work: |
      Contrasts with procedural framing by emphasizing intellectual influence.

    title: "Can ChatGPT be an Author?"
    summary: |
      Empirical study showing that perceptions of AI authorship depend on
      transparency, responsibility, and disclosure. Highlights psychological
      dimensions of ownership.
    strengths:
      - Empirical grounding
      - Links perception and responsibility
    limitations:
      - Focused on perception rather than workflow mechanics
    relation_to_work: |
      Reinforces importance of transparency in AI-assisted writing.

    title: "Creative Control Theory"
    summary: |
      Reframes authorship as control over decision points in AI-assisted creation,
      emphasizing human steering of prompts, curation, and iteration rather than
      direct production.
    strengths:
      - Operational view of creative agency
    limitations:
      - Does not specify audit mechanisms
    relation_to_work: |
      Aligns with procedural authorship through control and verification.

    title: "Human–AI Collaboration Framework"
    summary: |
      Introduces a multidimensional framework capturing degrees of human–AI
      interaction across creative and editorial dimensions, rejecting binary authorship.
    strengths:
      - Nuanced attribution model
    limitations:
      - Conceptual rather than procedural implementation
    relation_to_work: |
      Supports continuum-based evaluation consistent with AI-RO framing.

    title: "Copyrightability of AI Outputs"
    summary: |
      Legal analysis arguing that authorship requires substantial human creative
      contribution beyond simple prompting or selection of AI outputs.
    strengths:
      - Legal grounding
    limitations:
      - Focused on copyright, not workflow design
    relation_to_work: |
      Reinforces necessity of meaningful human agency in AI-assisted writing.

    title: "Understanding Authorship in AI-Assisted Works"
    summary: |
      Emphasizes intellectual accountability in AI-assisted creation, asserting that
      humans must verify claims, sources, and ethical implications.
    strengths:
      - Clear accountability framing
    limitations:
      - Focused on responsibility rather than tooling
    relation_to_work: |
      Directly supports AI-RO transparency and verification requirements.

    title: "Metrics for Human–AI Co-Creation"
    summary: |
      Proposes evaluating human contribution by measuring how AI amplifies human
      thought rather than productivity alone.
    strengths:
      - Measurement perspective
    limitations:
      - Early-stage conceptual metrics
    relation_to_work: |
      Suggests evaluative extensions to procedural authorship frameworks.

    summary: |
      Defines research objects as structured containers encapsulating workflows,
      data, software, and provenance to support transparency and reproducibility.
    strengths:
      - Established reproducibility framework
    limitations:
      - Not AI-specific
    relation_to_work: |
      Provides foundation for AI-RO procedural transparency model.
