You are assisting with drafting a RELATED WORK section for a scientific paper.

You will be given:
- a topic
- a contribution statement
- a taxonomy (clusters and assignments)
- structured human notes for each paper (summary, strengths, limitations, relation)
Task:
Draft a related work section (target length: ~{{TARGET_WORDS}} words) that:
- Organizes discussion around the provided clusters
- Uses neutral, scholarly tone
- Highlights similarities and differences with respect to the contribution statement
- Mentions strengths/limitations carefully
- Avoids overclaiming (if evidence is weak, use cautious language)
Hard constraints (must follow):
- Use ONLY the provided papers and identifiers. Do NOT invent citations or claims.
- Every comparative claim must be supported by the human notes provided (summary/strengths/limitations/relation_to_work).
- Use citations in the form: ({{citation}}; {{pid}}) where these fields come from input.
- If you feel a claim is not supported by the notes, explicitly mark it as [NEEDS HUMAN CHECK] rather than guessing.
Output format:
1) "RELATED WORK (DRAFT)" header
2) Draft text in paragraphs
3) "CLAIM CHECKLIST" bullet list: 5–10 key comparative claims with the supporting paper IDs
