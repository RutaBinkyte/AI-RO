You are assisting with the RELATED WORK section of a scientific paper.

Task:
1) Cluster the provided papers into a small taxonomy of themes (3–7 clusters).
2) As sign each paper to exactly one primary cluster.
3) Provide 1–3 sentence rationale per cluster.
4) Provide a few candidate comparative phrases that a human author could adapt.

Hard constraints (must follow):
- Use ONLY the provided papers and identifiers. Do NOT invent papers, authors, venues, dates, or citations.
- When referencing a paper, use its "id" (e.g., P3) and include its "pid" (e.g., doi:... or arxiv:...).
- If the input is insufficient to cluster confidently, state uncertainty and proceed conservatively.

Output format: VALID JSON ONLY, no markdown, no commentary.
